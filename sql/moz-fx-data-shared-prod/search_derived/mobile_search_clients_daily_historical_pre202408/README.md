# Mobile Search Clients Daily Historical (Pre-August 2024)

## Overview

The `mobile_search_clients_daily_historical_pre202408` table contains client-level daily search metrics for Mozilla's mobile Firefox products (Firefox for Android, Firefox for iOS, Focus, etc.) for the historical period up to and including **July 31, 2024**.

This table represents a critical snapshot of search behavior during the transition period when Mozilla moved from collecting metrics via the **metrics ping** to the **baseline ping**. The cutoff date of July 31, 2024, marks the end of the metrics ping era, with all subsequent data being collected through baseline ping and stored in the current operational tables.

### Key Characteristics

- **Data Period**: All dates up to and including 2024-07-31
- **Granularity**: One row per client per day per search engine per source combination
- **Table Type**: Client-level aggregated metrics
- **Partition Field**: `submission_date`
- **Data Retention**: 775 days (approximately 2 years)
- **Source Ping Type**: Metrics ping (historical method)

## Purpose

This table serves several critical functions:

1. **Historical Analysis**: Enables longitudinal studies comparing search behavior across the metrics-to-baseline ping transition
2. **Baseline Comparison**: Provides a reference dataset for validating the new baseline ping methodology
3. **Trend Analysis**: Supports multi-year search trend analysis when combined with current tables
4. **Data Continuity**: Ensures no data loss during the migration period
5. **Partner Reporting**: Maintains historical search partner revenue data for reconciliation

## Schema

The table contains 33 columns organized into the following categories:

### Identifiers & Temporal Dimensions
- `submission_date`: Partition key for the data collection date (â‰¤ 2024-07-31)

## Data Sources

### Primary Source
- **Table**: `moz-fx-data-shared-prod.search_derived.mobile_search_clients_daily_v1`
- **Filter**: `submission_date <= '2024-07-31'`
- **Ping Type**: Metrics ping (Glean)

### Upstream Dependencies
The source table aggregates data from:
- Mobile metrics ping telemetry
- Glean client_info metadata
- Search telemetry events
- GeoIP lookup services

## Update Schedule

**Status**: Static historical table (no ongoing updates)

This table is **frozen** as of the August 1, 2024 cutoff date. It does not receive updates and serves purely as an archival dataset. For current mobile search data (August 2024 onwards), query the baseline ping-based tables.

### Partitioning
- **Type**: Daily partitioning by `submission_date`
- **Required**: Partition filter is required for all queries (performance optimization)
- **Expiration**: Partitions expire after 775 days

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Daily Search Volume by App
```sql
SELECT
  submission_date,
  normalized_app_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS active_clients,
  SUM(search_count) AS total_searches,
  SUM(tagged_sap) AS monetized_searches
FROM
  `moz-fx-data-shared-prod.search_derived.mobile_search_clients_daily_historical_pre202408`
WHERE
  submission_date BETWEEN '2024-07-01' AND '2024-07-31'
GROUP BY
  submission_date,
  normalized_app_name
ORDER BY
  submission_date DESC;
```

### Example 2: Search Engine Market Share
```sql
SELECT
  normalized_engine,
  COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) AS users,
  SUM(search_count) AS searches,
  ROUND(SUM(search_count) * 100.0 / SUM(SUM(search_count)) OVER (), 2) AS market_share_pct
FROM
  `moz-fx-data-shared-prod.search_derived.mobile_search_clients_daily_historical_pre202408`
WHERE
  submission_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-07-31'
  AND normalized_engine IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  normalized_engine
ORDER BY
  searches DESC;
```

### Example 3: Geographic Distribution Analysis

## Important Notes

### Data Quality Considerations
1. **Metrics Ping Limitations**: This data was collected via metrics ping, which had known limitations around:
   - Delayed submission timing
   - Potential data loss on app termination
   - Different aggregation windows compared to baseline ping

2. **Transition Artifacts**: Dates near the July 31, 2024 cutoff may show anomalies due to the migration process

3. **Sampling**: Use `sample_id` field for consistent random sampling (each sample_id represents ~1% of clients)

### Performance Best Practices
1. **Always** include `submission_date` in WHERE clause (partition filter required)
2. Use `sample_id` for large-scale exploratory analysis: `WHERE sample_id = 0` (1% sample)
3. Filter on indexed fields (`client_id`, `country`, `normalized_engine`) when possible
4. Consider pre-aggregating at weekly/monthly level for long-term trend analysis

### Privacy & Data Governance
- Client-level data: Requires appropriate data access permissions
- Contains potentially sensitive search behavior patterns
- Must comply with Mozilla's data retention and deletion policies
- Be mindful of re-identification risks when combining with other datasets
